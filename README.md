# React For Beginners

## prerequisites
Someone wants to set up a nice gh-pages jekyll structure?

## What should learners know already?
- some JS
- some HTML

## What?
Library for creating component based user interfaces. Created at Facebook, widely used.

Why?
Because it's based on existing skills (knowing HTML and JS) and adds some functionality which allows you to create and use components.

## Setup
Find the most simple beginner-friendly quick setup (online JSX Transform?).
https://github.com/gaearon/react-hot-boilerplate is fairly straightforward to start with.
Goal: HTML/JS template that works. There should not be a complicated dev setup if possible. (Maybe as bonus in the end for advanced learners?)

## What is a component?
Some bundled up JS and HTML, which performs a specific bit of functionality or shows a specific bit of UI (a button, an input in a form). Some components can make use of other components to create a larger one.

## What is JSX?
HTML in JS, with some small differences.

## How to build simplest component possible
This should be the template to c&p from and to understand the super simple basics.

## Using components in other components
Get used to put components into each other

## Learn about props & state in components
Learn what props and state are, what to use for what and where

## Using interactive components, passing on props
Learn how to use a component inside of another component where the outer component passes on some props into the inner component.

## What is the component lifecycle and why should i care?
- React and the DOM
- don't manipulate dom elements, manipulate component state/props

## How do I get external data?
- Show a simple example with axios or the fetch API, getting data and using it in a component.
